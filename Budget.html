<h2>Budget</h2>
<a href="images/new2.jpg" id="img">  <img src="images/new2.jpg" id="img"></a>
<p>NASA's share of the total federal budget peaked at approximately 4.41% in 1966 during the Apollo program, then rapidly declined to approximately 1% in 1975, and stayed around that level through 1998. The percentage then gradually dropped, until leveling off again at around half a percent in 2006 (estimated in 2012 at 0.48% of the federal budget). In a March 2012 hearing of the United States Senate Science Committee, science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson testified that "Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow."</p>

<p>Despite this, public perception of NASA's budget differs significantly: a 1997 poll indicated that most Americans believed that 20% of the federal budget went to NASA.</p>

<p>For Fiscal Year 2015, NASA received an appropriation of US$18.01 billion from Congress—$549 million more than requested and approximately $350 million more than the 2014 NASA budget passed by Congress.</p>

<p>In Fiscal Year 2016, NASA received $19.3 billion.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump signed the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 in March, which set the 2017 budget at around $19.5 billion.[134] The budget is also reported as $19.3 billion for 2017, with $20.7 billion proposed for FY2018.</p>

<p>Examples of some proposed FY2018 budgets:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Exploration: $4.79 billion</li>
        <li>Planetary science: $2.23 billion</li>
        <li>Earth science: $1.92 billion</li>
    <li>    Aeronautics: $0.685 billion</li></ul>
